The trending news of yesterday was the [acquisition of GitHub](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) (the world's leading software development platform) by [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/). This is a great deal for Microsoft which might put it in the position it was about 10 years ago in the software market. But a lot of open-source fans are unhappy with this. 

A couple of years ago Microsoft was anti-open-source.

> "Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business." - Jim Allchin (Former Windows chief), 2001

> "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches." - Steve Ballmer (Former CEO)

However, in recent years Microsoft has tried hard to catch up with the open-source world. They are promoting themselves as a supporter of open-source. They have open-sourced [some of their projects](https://opensource.microsoft.com/) and also joined [The Linux Foundation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-completes-its-linux-journey-joins-the-linux-foundation/) as a platinum member.

Nobody knows whether they are doing this because they accepted that open-source is good or they are just trying to stay in the business by getting the attention of open-source users. Surely there are trust issues. Some GitHub users have already started looking for alternatives.
