This Google Trends analysis shows how the interest of Python worldwide scaled up above all other Object-Oriented Programming languages in the last few years. Almost every industry worldwide is using Python somehow due to its wide range of applications and easy to understand syntax. So, learning Python would make you a proficient software developer who is job-ready and can apply his/her skills to solve real-world problems.

Another great reason for learning Python is it’s large Open Source community. If you run into any error then you will surely find other people on Github or Stack Overflow with same errors and also one’s those who have already solved that error and posted a possible fix to that.

## Features
1. Dynamically typed: Unlike Java or C++ we don’t have to mention about the data type when assigning variables, Python has the ability to figure that out on its own.
2. Interpreted: We don't need a compiler to convert Python to machine code which our computer’s processor can read, just executing the program does all compilation behind the scenes.
3. Easy to Read
4. Huge range of Libraries and modules supported.

## Applications
- Data Science
- Web Development
- Generic Operating System Services
- Image Processing
- Scientific Computing
