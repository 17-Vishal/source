## Introduction
[Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/), a C and Simula67 enthusiast, thought of combining the best of both the languages, and subsequently, C++ emanated at [AT&T Bell Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA, in the early 1980’s. Stroustrup’s **C with Classes** became C++ in 1983, the ‘++’ denoting the Increment Operator in C. The programming language can run on a number of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and numerous versions of UNIX. The most recent version of C++ programming language is C++ 17, revised by [ISO/IEC 14882 standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard).

## Popularity of C++
The [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/cplusplus/) indicates that C and C++ are till date among the most used languages among programmers. Being a combination of both high-level and low-level language, C++ is regarded as a "middle-level" language. The language has evolved with time, and as of now, possesses facilities for low-level memory manipulation in addition to object-oriented, generic and functional features. It supports Object Oriented Programming in its entirety including the four pillars of object-oriented development, namely

1. Encapsulation
2. Data Hiding
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Applications of C++
1. **Operating Systems**:
Being a strongly typed language in addition to being fast, C++ becomes a perfect choice when it comes to writing operating systems. C being analogous to assembly language, further aids in writing low-level operating system modules. Hence, it is no surprise that most of the softwares of Microsoft are developed using C++, also Mac OSX has some of its parts written in C++.
2. **Browsers**:
The fast performance of C++ makes it an ideal choice for the rendering engines of various browsers. [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/in/safari/) are developed using C++.
3. **Libraries**:
C++ is used as the backend programming language of many high-level libraries, for example, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/); one of the most significantly used Machine Learning Libraries.
4. **Databases**:
C++ is used in writing Database Management Softwares. Two of the most popular Databases, [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) are written in C and C++.
5. **GUI based Applications**:
"Speed" is what matters in graphics applications because it helps the developers in expanding their target audience. Applications which have high-end graphical processing like most of the applications of the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/in/creativecloud.html) viz. Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. are developed by using C++.
6. **Cloud Systems**:
The compatibility of C++ with a lot of machines along with its affinity with the hardware makes it a perfect choice for cloud storage and distributed systems. Load tolerance and high concurrency is provided by the multithreading libraries in C++ which becomes a huge advantage. 

In addition to the above mentioned applications, C++ is also majorly used in Embedded Systems, Compilers and Banking Applications besides a multitude of other uses.
